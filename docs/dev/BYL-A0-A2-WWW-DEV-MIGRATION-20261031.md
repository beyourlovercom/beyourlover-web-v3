# BYL V3 A0–A2 — WWW → Dev Catalog Baseline (2026-10-31)

## Evidence and boundary
- WWW is production WooCommerce/transactional data authority; Dev is the isolated UAT target; GitHub main is code authority.
- Cart V2 Owner PASS and Checkout V3 merged source do not prove current runtime. Commerce E2E #87 stays HOLD.
- Live A0/A1 two-site DB/runtime evidence is **not verified**: BYL DC device metadata READY but remote operation returned OPERATOR_TOOL_DENIED; secondary DC read-only is quota-blocked.
- This draft supplies only read-only WP-CLI catalog export, offline JSON diff, tests and a migration contract. No import or deployment.

## A0 — read-only inventory and dry-run
- Obtain exact HTTP host/TLS, PHP/WP/Woo/version, environment, theme and MU/plugin runtime hashes; non-sensitive totals of products, variations, categories, attributes, attachments, pages/posts; sanitized shipping/currency rules (never secrets).
- Audit WWW/Dev R2 img.beyourlover.com mapping, media IDs, categories and original SKU/variation identity.
- Through independently authorized secure WP-CLI, run scripts/byl_a0_a2_catalog_export.php as a trusted temporary file outside each webroot, producing one protected JSON snapshot per site. Example: wp eval-file /trusted/path/byl_a0_a2_catalog_export.php --quiet > /protected/report/www-catalog.json. Repeat with Dev.
- On a local machine, compare snapshots with: python3 scripts/byl_a0_a2_catalog_diff.py --www /protected/report/www-catalog.json --dev /protected/report/dev-catalog.json --out /protected/report/diff.json.
- Compare generated timestamps if WWW product edits happen during export. No customer/real-order data, credentials or snapshot files are to be checked into GitHub.
- The result is always HOLD or DRY_RUN_ONLY, never authorization to import. WordPress post IDs / attachment IDs are not portable.

## A1 — fail-closed Dev gates: ALL REQUIRED
- [ ] Live Dev has staging environment, expected home_url HTTPS and access protection.
- [ ] Dev SEO noindex; no Dev URLs in canonical or public sitemap.
- [ ] Running MU/plugin exact hashes and effective gates verified on Dev. Source-only existence is insufficient.
- [ ] Gateways TEST; checkout and order submission denied except timeboxed owner-approved Canary.
- [ ] Woo/background mail blocked; no leftover exception allowing arbitrary real send.
- [ ] AfterShip/Automizely outbound and order/customer inbound blocked. Independently check ERP/WMS/Shipout/SM/CRM, external callbacks and Cron; existing MU gate is not proof of complete provider isolation.
- [ ] No WWW payment/affiliate secrets, subscriber data, customers or live orders copied to Dev.
- [ ] Dev DB/files backup SHA + independently verified restore path, outside webroot.
- [ ] A0 fresh source and destination report, SKU collisions and media exceptions reviewed.

## A2 — proposed incremental batch process, CURRENTLY HOLD
1. Use unique SKU; for SKU-less variation, only unique parent SKU plus attribute values. Quarantine duplicates, missing/ambiguous keys, missing media.
2. Verify allowlist of product/variation/category/media fields, preserving separate Woo IDs. Preserve ERP stock ownership; never blindly copy inventory counts.
3. Review A0 preview; obtain backup and scoped owner approval before creating any Dev batch.
4. Small Canary on Dev → readback and exact-item journal → verified rollback → batch and idempotent rerun.
5. No WWW writes, no real customer/order data, no credentials, no payment/fulfillment notifications.
6. A2 closure only with actual Dev SKU/media discrepancy readback and safe recovery evidence.

## Source test commands
- python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts -p 'test_byl_a0_a2_catalog_diff.py'
- php -l scripts/byl_a0_a2_catalog_export.php
